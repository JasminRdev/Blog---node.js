# Blog---node.js
https://secure-beyond-84399.herokuapp.com/ This project is a simple blog where you can add composes that will render on the home page. "Home, About and Contact us" in the header is a link to an individual site with the same header and footer like we can see on the homepage thanks to ejs templating. To make composes we click on the orange button on the bottom. After rendering this get method /compose route the data input from title and compose will be hold in an array called "posts". In the home page we render every single item from that array with the forEach function. Finally "params" is used to tap into whatever gets after the get route of "domain/posts/" and create dynamically the website of each composed article. Because since we just show 100 characters of the compose on the homepage instead clicking on the article we render the full text from the compose on another website. Lodash is used to don't get problems of lower or uppercase of the title we type inside the compose page.
